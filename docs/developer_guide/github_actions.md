# GitHub Actions

## CI Workflow

The CI workflow contains the jobs that run in pull requests and pushes to the `main` branch:

- `tests`: run tox on various Python versions and operating systems
- `coverage`: generates code coverage reports for the docs site and README status badge
- `docs-build`: builds the docs site
- `markdownlint`: lints Markdown files
- `markdown-link-check`: checks links in Markdown files work
- `docs-deploy` and `docs-delete`: automate [docs versioning](docs.md#versioning)

Notes:

- tox is used to ensure that results can be replicated locally
- Not all jobs run every workflow call: see the `if` keyword in each job
- Some jobs depend on other jobs: see the `needs` keyword in each job
- Artifacts are used to access the coverage reports generated by `tests` in `coverage`:
